				<span>1. Pokemon Starters Battle</span>
				<p>This is my first game ever coded in HTML, CSS and JS, it is essentially the classic game of scissors paper rock, but with the iconic starter Pokemon Charmander, Bulbasaur and Squirtle! Nothing complicated in this one, just play against the computer! </p>
			</div>
			<div class="indexes" id="index2" onclick="location.href='jscalculator/index.html';">
				<span link="index.html">2. Javascript Calculator</span>
				<p>This is a very simple calculator (4-Function) coded using just HTML, CSS and Javascript. The main point of this project was to broaden the skills I gained from the first project, and to code something a bit more interactive.</p>
